# Weather App

This is weather app made with React.

## Live version is deployed on: 

  https://kivi-weather-app.netlify.app

## Getting started

Install Node v18.15.0.

1. npm install
2. npm run start.

## Features

Just type any city you know and you will get current weather data: temperature, forecast, humidity, real feel and wind speed.

  - plan is to connect forecast call from API with background images.

## Tools

Weather API used is from Open Weather - you can get free subscription and other details how to use API keys and make API calls on this site => https://openweathermap.org.

Also I used axios. Axios is a simple promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. Axios provides a simple to use library in a small package with a very extensible interface. Just visit => https://axios-http.com.
